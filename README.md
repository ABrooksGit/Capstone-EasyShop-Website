Easy-Shop-Website
This easy shop website uses the Easy-Shop-API and creates a interface that a user can interact with. This includes visuals for all products, browsing by color, setting price ranges and even by type of product. This website has a log in feature where you can log into an account which was already registered. Once logged in you will be able to head to the profile page to set that up. When you have done all that, you can head back to the main page and add products to your cart. For each different product you add, the number on the cart, at the top left will add one additional number. When adding from the same product multiple times, the product will be added, but it wont affect the cart number. Lastly, if you want to clear the entire cart. Head over to the cart, and press clear.
For the changes I made to this site, it was pretty small, but the website originally had a small bug where it said minimum price and minimum price when pricing by range, so I had went and fixed it to say minimum and maximum.
